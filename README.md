# Introduction

In the realm of pharmaceutical management, efficient data organization and retrieval are paramount. To address this need, I embarked on a project to design and implement a comprehensive Pharmacy Database system. The project commenced with the creation of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram and a relational schema using Erwin, a powerful tool for visualizing database structures.

## Database Implementation

For the backend data storage, I opted for two approaches separately, leveraging both MySQL for relational data storage and MongoDB for NoSQL data management. This strategic decision allowed for the best of both worlds: the robustness of relational databases combined with the flexibility of NoSQL databases.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development

To facilitate seamless interaction with the database, I developed a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI was meticulously crafted to streamline CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, thereby enhancing usability and functionality. Users can effortlessly navigate through the database, perform operations with ease, and retrieve information efficiently.
